summary:
- line: A rich variety of intermediary colors appear in this piece, through an
    optical mix between three primary colors mixed in darker or lighter shades.
    The block-like and circular paintstrokes establish continuity between the
    foreground and background. In the spirit of pointilist art, brushstrokes are
    layered to convey a shimmering sense of volume and form.
