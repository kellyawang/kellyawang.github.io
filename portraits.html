summary:
- line: There’s something melancholy about a stiff collared shirt
    tossed aside, lying crumpled on the floor. Wearing a
    collared shirt makes me feel confident. It reassures the
    world that I’ve “got everything together,” even when I
    really, really don’t. What do we suffer from hiding our
    hearts -- our emotive cores -- under a collared shirt?
    In my piece, the shirts themselves become artifacts of our
    insecurity, surrogates for a human body afflicted by
    emotional unrest.
- line: I created this piece for a Studio Art course investigating
    the abstract and tangible properties that give
    certain objects power in our world. Through a process of
    experimentation and intellectual engagement with the objects
    that surround us, we developed artist statements (above) and
    created works for a gallery exhibition at Williams College.
