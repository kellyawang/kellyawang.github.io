summary:
- line: This is a short trailer created for an infinite runner game I
    programmed in G3D. The player is a pink polyhedron rushing towards the
    end of the road to upbeat music and picking up as many points as possible
    along the way. I composed the visual environment of the game and worked
    especially on refining the player experience. Week 1 was spent implementing
    user interaction with placeholder game pieces. Week 2 was spent completing
    implementation and finalizing design.
