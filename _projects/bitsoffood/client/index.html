                <p>
                    While domain experts debate the earth's carrying capacity, human presence continues to multiply. The
                    population growth rate has slowed globally, but Africa maintains a steady pace: from 1963 to 2013
                    the continent inflated its share of the world's population from 9.5% to 15.6%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That 'bigger stake' has not translated into a flourishing food production industry. Africa has
                    improved its food balance sheets, though not in proportion to its human needs. Export trade value
                    has remarkably declined over the fifty year period as many countries deal with political instability
                    and extreme climate variability. Even so, livestock and agricultural products remain one of the most
                    promising sectors for traditionally agrarian economies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Environmental concerns should register as a primary alarm in Africa. Since 1963 emissions related to
                    fertilization and cultivation have doubled. Other related indicators should also be considered in
                    future study, including land use, livestock husbandry, pesticide application, industrial processes
                    and waste.

                        Defining Africa as a single unit is an often made, misleading over-simplification. It is a
                        continent, composed of a collection of countries with at least as many differences as
                        similarities. The 20th Century was a liberating period for many nations as colonial bindings
                        were persistently broken. In this context it especially important to consider historical and
                        cultural factors before making hasty conclusions from numerical outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regrettably the scope of this study does not include such germane analyses but instead offers
                        the opportunity to discern features of a nation's food economy that might lead to useful
                        comparative and critical leads and insights. For example, to rebalance unnecessary dependencies
                        on import products or to discover new, promising opportunities for export products, leaders in
                        the sector should evaluate not only their portfolio but also the results of neighbors that share
                        similar biotopes and markets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For further study it may helpful to define past and present political and trade relationships
                        that might point to serve as platforms for improved efficiencies.

                    In a world of even distribution, a country with X% of the world's population should be responsible
                    for X% of the world's food production, trade value and emissions. Of course such a point-of-view is
                    both naïve and quixotic, and yet some standard must be offered as a basis for comparison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When represented graphically, the shape of each African country takes on a distinct shape in
                    comparison to population-defined standards for Africa and the world. Even so most countries fall
                    noticeably short of food production and trade value prescriptions, which is problematic for health
                    and economy.
                <p>
                    If a primitive linear predictive model based on the past 50 years is applied, these gaps will
                    continue to widen. The UN, African Union and other organizations have composed goals to resolve
                    these imbalances, not for the first time. To produce meaningful change, public and private
                    stakeholders need to demonstrate similar conviction and commitment.

                    Unsurprisingly the abstract nature of quantitative evaluation evades emotion and empathy. However
                    the imbalance these number represent grim consequences for millions of people throughout the
                    continent who do not have sufficient access to food resources. As of 2013, more than 200 million
                    people in Africa are undernourished, and the UN's findings indicate that this figure is only
                    increasing year-by-year.

                <p>
                    The FOA began monitoring food security after establishing "Zero Hunger" as a core sustainable
                    development goal at the beginning of the 21st century. The issue is complex - in recent years,
                    indicators have expanded to include an array of factors related to availability, access, stability
                    and utilization, as well as other social issues, including gender, family size and structure and
                    education.

                <p>
                    Surprisingly the food balance sheets for countries with considerable food security issues indicate
                    that there is often sufficient production to meet the caloric needs, and so closer audit of food
                    management is in order.
