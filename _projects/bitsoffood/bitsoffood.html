summary:
- line: These visualizations were created as a final project for CS171 (Data Visualization) at the Harvard Extension School
- line: We were interested in creating a data-driven view of Africa's food production, dimensioned by social,
    environmental and economic factors. Generally, global food production, population, emissions and trade values
    are increasing, and we compare these worldwide trends across the African continent to discern the current
    status and potential opportunities and concerns. To bolster this high-level overview, we examine
    the same factors within defined geographical regions and countries - allowing users to learn more about
    specific statistical features. Furthermore, we model these trends toward predictive futures in order
    to preview a possible outcome if the data trends continue. Our early analysis suggests that there will be
    significant challenges, which we intend to emphasize along with potential strengths that might serve
    as a basis for potential solutions.
- line: The data to support this project is available through the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (”FOA”) data portal. http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data
