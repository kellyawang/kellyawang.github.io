summary:
- line: During my internship at Bit Films, an independent animation studio, I
    worked as a generalist and digital artist on a proof-of-concept short for an
    animated adventure series. In all materials, I had primary responsibility for
    creating digital environment art and prop design, before sending it down the
    pipeline for final editing tweaks and compositing. Over the course of the
    summer, I also edited together each sequence of the progressing film for
    daily team reviews.
- line: This film combined the 2D and 3D worlds of animation by overlaying 3D
    animated characters with flat, two-toned shading on top of 2D painted backgrounds.

        <h3 class="NewPioneersWrap">The Opening Scene</h3>
        <p>June 2015
        <br>I created the 2D art for the main character's bed and pillow from the opening scene.</p>

        <h3 class="NewPioneersWrap">The Boys' Bedroom</h3>
        <p>June 2015
        <br>I created the primary 2D art for the boys' bedroom and bed. I also
            designed and painted the blanket texture, which was mapped onto a
            separate piece of geometry (shown below).</p>

        <h3 class="NewPioneersWrap">The Housing Sector</h3>
        <p>July 2015
        <br>This was the establishing shot of the housing area. I focused
            particularly on developing details in the background and foreground
            that would create a sense of place and give the world a unique character.</p>

        <h3 class="NewPioneersWrap">Cracked Ground</h3>
        <p>August 2015
        <br>I also painted a series of these flat cracked ground images. For each
            shot, I imported them as 3D planes into the scene file and linked
            them to the animated camera.</p>

        <h3 class="NewPioneersWrap">Log Weapon</h3>
        <p>August 2015
        <br>This is the design for a wicked piece of weaponry that is used in
            one scene to fight off a giant monster. Through multiple iterations
            of critiques and small adjustments to the overall shape and silhouette
            of the weapon, I arrived at a final 2D design which I then handed
            off to the modeling team to create it in 3D.</p>

        <h3 class="NewPioneersWrap">Old Blanket</h3>
        <p>August 2015
        <br>I provided the texture for the blanket used to cover the two boys in
            the bed. After I finished the painting, I passed the image file to
            a teammate to create its 3D equivalent.</p>

        <h3 class="NewPioneersWrap">Dagger</h3>
        <p>July 2015
        <br>A fancy dagger that the main character uses to fight off a monster.</p>
