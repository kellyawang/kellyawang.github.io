summary:
- line: This interactive, computational art installation was generated by
    custom software written in Processing. A webcam sitting atop the screen
    captures a continuous video feed, which is processed by a facial recognition
    algorithm. Found faces are tracked and mapped in real time to a 2D array of
    pixels, and translated to a reactive video display.
- line: Exhibited in a gallery show at the Williams College Museum of Art.

        <p>Brainstorming Process:</p>
<!--                            <p>First, I had to define the ways humans could interact with code in an interesting way.-->
        <p>Drawing inspiration from the work of Camille Utterback and Theodore Watson, and Petros Vrellis' interactive Starry Night app. </p>

        <p>I started out with some early sketches to work out the facial recognition and tracking. I experimented with reactive pattern-making and different abstract shapes and colors:</p>

        <p><img width="540" src="assets/img/details/split/Sketch_5.png" alt=""></p>

        <p>I was increasingly drawn to the overlapping, abstract shapes and the assertive,
            sharp edges of the triangles. As people move laterally through the
          space in front of the screen, the long, blade-like triangles lance across
          the screen towards the found faces (denoted by the green circles).</p>
