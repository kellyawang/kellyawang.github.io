summary:
- line: This interactive, computational art installation was generated by
    custom software written in Processing. A webcam sitting atop the screen
    captures a continuous video feed, which is processed by a facial recognition
    algorithm. Found faces are tracked and mapped in real time to a 2D array of
    pixels, and translated to a reactive video display.
- line: Exhibited in a gallery show at the Williams College Museum of Art.
