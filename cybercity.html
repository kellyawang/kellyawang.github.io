summary:
- line: 'This film was made during the CS371: Computational Graphics course at
    Williams College in the Fall of 2014. Videos were created and rendered using
    the open-source C++ G3D Innovation Engine with original cinematography,
    design, and open-source music.'
- line: This short film features a procedurally generated city illuminated by
    neon lights designed, modeled, and rendered as part of a midterm group project.
    I was responsible for creating 3D models that were used as
    building blocks for the buildings in the city. Given a set of these building blocks,
    we defined an algorithmic grammar that combined and recombined these small units
    to produce a single building. I also led the team in developing a unified
    artistic vision that carried through to the final film.
- line: Watch in HD!

        <p>Stills and Behind the Scenes:</p>
        <p>Because each building file became so massive, we needed to be strategic
        when placing each building in the 3D scene, to save memory and
        to optimize compute time. Our solution was to first create a proxy city made
        up of simple rectangles, and then copy the locations of each dummy building
        to the real city. During filming of the video, we created a method for defining spline curves
        followed by the "camera" in the proxy city, and then we transferred the
        camera movements to the real city. </p>
        <p>Having highly collaborative and dedicated team members allowed us to recognize
            when we needed to scale down our efforts in certain areas. We worked together
            to stay on track throughout the project and complete each component of the project in a timely manner.</p>
