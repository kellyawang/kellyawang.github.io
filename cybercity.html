summary:
- line: 'This film was made during the CS371: Computational Graphics course at
    Williams College in the Fall of 2014. Videos were created and rendered using
    the open-source C++ G3D Innovation Engine with original cinematography and
    artistic design and open-source music.'
- line: This short film features a procedurally generated city illuminated by
    neon lights designed, modeled, and rendered as part of a midterm group project.
    I was responsible for modeling and creating 3D models that were used as
    primitives in an original grammar that generated the buildings. I also led the
    team in developing a unified artistic vision that carried through to the final
    film.
<!-- - line: Our group made strategic decisions for the two week span of the project
    in deciding to split up into teams that focused on creating the basic primitives,
    generating each building, generating an entire city, and writing scripts and an
    interface to manage the entire process. Because each building file was so
    massive, we needed to strategize when we were defining spline curves for the
    making of the video, and thus created a method for defining splines in a proxy
    city made up of simple rectangles, and then transferring the camera movements
    to the real city. Having responsive and dedicated team members allowed us to
    recognize when we needed to scale down our efforts in certain areas, and how to
    stay on track and complete each component of the project in a timely manner. -->
