summary:
- line: This short film was created for a lesson on rendering implicit surfaces
    using GLSL shaders I wrote and ran on the GPU. I created the skull piece by
    piece as a whimsical response to the prompt. Each shot is composed with attention
    to camera angles and varying tempo of both subject and camera movement.
- line: This film won "Best Animated Film" in Williams College Movie Madness Contest (2016)
