			<h2>Animated Adventure Series for Kids</h2>   
			<hr>
			    <p>This past summer I had the incredible opportunity to intern at Bit Films, an independent animation studio in Central Massachusetts. I worked as a generalist and digital artist on a proof-of-concept test for an animated adventure series currently being developed at Bit Films. In all materials, I had primary responsibility for creating digital environment art and prop design, before sending it down the pipeline for final editing tweaks and compositing. Over the course of the summer, I also edited together each sequence of the progressing film for daily team reviews. This film combined the 2D and 3D worlds of animation by overlaying 3D animated characters with flat, two-toned shading on top of 2D painted backgrounds. <!--I learned far more than I could have ever imagined from this experience, particularly from active participation in daily progress reviews with the entire production team.

			   		June 2015
			   		<br>Adobe Photoshop

						<p>Desktop items come to life in this object animation short. The Cube, a new, technologically advanced device, enters into their midst, but even as it threatens to make the desktop characters obsolete, the next release of Cubes (Red) is already in production. This was my first stop animation movie, which I completed as part of a final group project. I was responsible for directing cinematography, framing each shot, taking clear and well-lit photos, and sustaining the artistic vision that carried us through the project.

						<p>This short film features a procedurally generated city illuminated by neon lights designed, modeled, and rendered as part of a midterm group project. I was responsible for modeling and creating 3D models that were used as primitives in an original grammar that generated the buildings. I also led the team in developing a unified artistic vision that carried through to the final film. 
						<br>
						Our group made strategic decisions for the two week span of the project in deciding to split up into teams that focused on creating the basic primitives, generating each building, generating an entire city, and writing scripts and an interface to manage the entire process. Because each building file was so massive, we needed to strategize when we were defining spline curves for the making of the video, and thus created a method for defining splines in a proxy city made up of simple rectangles, and then transferring the camera movements to the real city. Having responsive and dedicated team members allowed us to recognize when we needed to scale down our efforts in certain areas, and how to stay on track and complete each component of the project in a timely manner.

			<div class="row">
				<p>Thereâs something melancholy about a stiff collared shirt tossed aside, lying crumpled on the floor. Wearing a collared shirt makes me feel confident. It reassures the world that Iâve âgot everything together,â even when I really, really donât. Collared shirts act as a covering we wear over our upper bodies, but they also cover our hearts: our emotive cores. What do we suffer from hiding ourselves under a collared shirt? In my piece, the shirts themselves become artifacts of our insecurity, surrogates for the human body afflicted by inner emotional unrest.
				</p>
				<p>
				I created this piece for a Studio Art course investigating through art the abstract and tangible properties that give certain objects power in our world. Through a process of experimentation and intellectual engagement with theories about the objects that surround us, we developed our artist statements (above) and created works that were then shown in a gallery exhibition at Williams College.

						<p>This is an illustration inspired by the song "Plant Life" by Owl City. The whimsical song is an uplifting hopeful song which is reflected in the light at the end of the stairs, which to me is reminiscent of the feeling of a heavy weight being lifted off one's shoulders after a particularly challenging time in one's life.

					<p>I created this design and scale model during a Sustainable Architecture class. Given a location and a design prompt with specifications regarding square footage and amenities, I created a proposal for a building dedicated to Williams College's Outing Club. Along with elegant form and functionality, I also focused on elements of the building that would support sustainability, like the ideal angle of the roof for capturing the most sunlight at a certain latitude, and the placement of windows and apertures in the walls to providee air flow during warm seasons, and insulation during colder months. </p>

					<p>I created this design proposal and scale model over the summer at the Pre-College program at the Rhode Island School of Design Pre-College Program, as an concentrator in Architecture. The primary element in my model is a transparent floating mass that lets light into the central space and balances the visual weight of the opaque blocks around it. A linear walkway intersects the building, lifting foot traffic above the street behind the building, to the smaller mass behind it.</p>

							<p>These are two views of a sculpture I constructed over the summer during the Pre-College program at the Rhode Island School of Design. With this piece in particular, I enjoy the contrast between the simplicity of a cube and the complexity in the interior space of the cube, and each of its faces. No two faces are alike. Ribbons of space created by the window-like apertures and parallel lines across each face reveal the complexities in one of the simplest shapes that exist in our environment.
